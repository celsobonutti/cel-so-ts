## My first post
I've been thinking about what to write since I registered this domain. It was so perfect for me and so expensive that I couldn't just register it and do nothing. I thought of writing about many things in the tech: Vue's new composition API, Elixir (and GraphQL), WebAssembly with AssemblyScript, etc.  
It didn't work out: I don't have many things to talk about this stuff simply because I don't have much knowledge in these areas. What I know, though, is how difficult is to start working remotely: from the destroying loneliness that strikes you when working at home to the little demon that tells you you don't have work just because "no one is seeing".  
Although I don't have that much work experience at all, I've mostly worked in offices while wanting really bad to go remote, and I've been doing it since August.  
## The disillusion
**Of course** it wasn't the dream I thought it would be and it got me really stressed in less than a month. The loneliness of never being face-to-face with anyone was the hardest part, but here's a small list of things that made me anxious in my first month and how I learned to deal with them:  

### "I'm lying to my boss"
A thought that used to always be in my head is that I was never working enough: while I was in an office, being in it made me feel like I was always working, even if I was in the bathroom or crossing the entire building to get a cup of coffee. <i style="text-decoration: line-through">Thanks, hub salvador</i>  
This was pretty much the biggest problem I had, but after some time (and some 1-1s with [the nicest boss I've ever had](https://twitter.com/iamcherta/)) I noticed something way more important than how much time I spend with my ass in a chair: how much I add to the team.
### Not interacting enough with my co-workers, which make me feel disconnected to them
